###Fluid Design  (a form of Responsive)

####Pros
* 

####Cons
* Must download all elements required for even the desktop page []
  * Work around using media queries
Has mostly fluid design with one jump
On the bigger jump, only the left side is fluid (the image gets cut off), allowing for the right side to have content that can not get cut off, i.e. the authorâ€™s picture
