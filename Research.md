#Responsive vs. Fluid Web Design
###Responsive Design (has multiple set viewport widths) 
####Pros
* Allows for mobile obtimization
  * Show specific content tailored to mobile users (ex. 'download our app')
* Easy to test / adapt
    * Only have to test content for 3 - 6 viewports
    * Adjustments made to specific viewports won't affect others

####Cons
* Harder to maintain content as new screen resolutions and form factors continue to come out
* Requires mulitple layouts / multiple versions of content

####Examples
* [York Region site](http://york.ca)

###Fluid Design  (adjusts to any screen size)

####Pros
* Adapts to any form factor
* Only create one version of content

####Cons
* Must download all elements required for all viewports (performs worse) [1](http://studio.uxpin.com/blog/responsive-vs-adaptive-design-whats-best-choice-designers/)
  * Potential work arounds using media queries
* Must test every possible width to ensure no user has poor experience
* Content must either be able to be:
  * Cut off (ex. )
  * or cropped (ex. )
* Can't make adjustments to specific viewports

####Examples
* http://www.whatcounts.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/perform-better.htm
* http://hoovermason.com/#/
  * Has mostly fluid design with one jump
  * On the bigger jump, only the left side is fluid (the image gets cut off), allowing for the right side to have content that can not get cut off, i.e. the authorâ€™s picture
